    <h3 class="things">Things You Need</h3>
    <p>This list is compiled of all the materials needed to set up a tank in 
        which a Betta fish will live happy in and be able thrive.</p>
<ol class="deep">
    <ul>
        <li>Minimum 5 gallon tank</li>
        <li>Sponge filter</li>
        <li>Soft substrate (sand, pebbles)</li>
        <li>Live plants or silk plants</li>
        <li>Water treatment</li>

    <p>What I would consider to be <em>the</em> most important part of preparing
    your tank for your betta fish would be having your tank set up and 
    <strong>cycled</strong> <em>before</em> getting your betta fish.</p>
    <h3 class="how">How To Cylce Your Tank</h3>
    <p>One of the best ways to cycle your tank is by having some plants planted into 
        the aquarium without any fish and buying a whole test kit to be able to test 
        your parameters as you go. You will know your tank is ready whenever the plants 
        start to show new growth. This is when you are free to add your brand new betta fish!</p>
    <h3>How To Introduce Your Fish into Your Tank</h3>
    <p>There are two popular ways to acclimate your betta fish into your tank.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The first is by floating your fish in the bag or cup that it came in at the 
            top of the tank. You will gradually pour water from the tank into the bag/cup 
            until the water inside the bag/cup is at the same temperature as the water in 
            the tank. Once this has been done you may slowly and gently pour the betta fish
            into the tank.</li>
        <li>The second method is called the drip method. This method requires you to put the
            betta fish in a tub or bucket with enough water to allow it to swim around. You then
            use a tube with one end inside the tank, suck the other end to start the water flow 
            going, you then tie knots in the tube until the water is coming out in slow drops. You 
            then drop that same end into the tub/bucket containing your betta fish for 30 minutes to an hour.
            Once this is done, you are then able to gently pour your betta fish into the tank.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="taking">Taking Care of Your Fish</h3>
    <p>Once you have cycled your tank and acclimated your betta fish, all you have to do is keep up with feeding it
        on a daily basis. It is a good idea to skip a feeding day a week to allow their digestive system to have a break.
        It is also a good idea to rotate different kinds of food and treats to give your betta a variety in nutrients. 
        In order to keep the tank clean you must do a 20-30% water change. This basically means that your remove 20-30% 
        of the tank water, obtain some water of the same temperature as the tank water and add some drops of water treatment
        before finally pouring the new clean water into the tank. You must also take out any decorations and hide outs
        to be able to scrub them (without soap) to prevent algae growth. You also have to wipe the glass of the tank 
        clean to avoid algae growth.</p>
